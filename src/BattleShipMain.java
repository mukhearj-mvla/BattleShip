	 BattleShip read me:
- The left grid is your board and the right grid is the computer’s board
- To start, place your ships by clicking on the square where you want 
the top left of your ship to be. To place them horizontally, hold 
shift will clicking. You will place a ship of length 5 first, then a 
ship of a length 4, then a ship of length 3, etc.
- Once you’ve placed all 5 of your ships, you can start clicking on the 
computer’s board to attack their ships. If a square turns black, means 
you’ve missed. If a square turns red, that means you’ve hit the opponent’s 
ship.
- The game will end once you or the computer has sunk every ship.
